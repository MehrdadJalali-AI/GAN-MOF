Refcode – A unique identifier for each structure (e.g., a reference from a crystallographic database like the Cambridge Structural Database).
metals – The metal element(s) present in the structure.
max_metal_coordination_n – The maximum coordination number of the metal, indicating how many ligands or atoms are directly bonded to it.
metal_sbu_smile – SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the metal secondary building unit (SBU), which describes its atomic connectivity.
linker_smile – The SMILES representation of the organic linker connecting the metal SBUs.
n_sbu_point_of_extension – The number of extension points from the metal SBU, representing its connectivity.
n_linker_point_of_extension – The number of points where the linker extends and connects to the structure.
metal_cluster_smile – SMILES representation of the full metal cluster, which might be more complex than the individual SBU.
ligand_smile – SMILES representation of the coordinating ligand(s) attached to the metal.
n_channel – The number of channels in the structure, which may relate to porosity or transport properties.
void_fraction – The fraction of the unit cell volume that is void or empty space, useful for assessing porosity.
asa (A²) – Accessible Surface Area in square angstroms, indicating the exposed surface area within the MOF.
av (A³) – Accessible Volume in cubic angstroms, showing the total available volume within the framework.
pld (A) – Pore limiting diameter (in angstroms), which is the smallest free diameter for guest molecules to pass through.
lcd (A) – Largest cavity diameter, indicating the maximum open space in the framework.
lfpd (A) – Largest free path diameter, measuring the longest continuous open pathway within the structure.
