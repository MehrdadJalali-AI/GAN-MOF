        "The MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) similarity model computes pairwise similarities between different MOFs using both molecular and numerical feature-based approaches. The resulting adjacency matrix represents these relationships and is used to construct a similarity graph, where strong connections indicate structural or property-based similarity between MOFs.\n",
