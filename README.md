Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthetic Node Expansion in MOF Material Graphs

Overview

This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic nodes within MOFGalaxyNet, a material graph representation for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to expand MOF material networks by introducing synthetic nodes that correspond to novel MOFs with predicted properties and structures.

Key Features

MOFGalaxyNet-Based Graph Representation: The framework models MOFs as a structured graph where nodes represent existing MOFs, and edges denote similarities or relationships between them.

GAN-Powered Synthetic Node Generation: A GAN-based model generates new nodes representing novel MOFs within the material graph.

Graph Expansion and Property Prediction: The synthetic nodes are integrated into MOFGalaxyNet, allowing for property prediction and structural analysis.

Visualization and Evaluation: Tools to assess and visualize the expanded MOFGalaxyNet with newly generated MOFs.
